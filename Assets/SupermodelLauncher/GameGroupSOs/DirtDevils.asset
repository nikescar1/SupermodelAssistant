  gameSynopsis: "There is nothing clean about Dirt Racing!\r\n\nSega's R&D Team,
    AM3, creators of incredibly successful Jurassic Park \"The Lost World\" and top
    video game simulator Top Skater, take their technical genius to the road with
    their latest project Dirt Devils.\r\n\nGet behind the wheel of one of five super
    cars and experience the feel and strategy of real dirt racing. Hold on tight
    as you slide your super-charged off-road vehicle through unbelievably sharp turns,
    bottom-out in huge potholes, fly through dual level intersections, navigate through
    watery swamps, and attempt driving at night with only your headlights to guide
    you. A rear view mirror and onboard radar screen help you keep track of your
    competition, as you race for glory, on Get behind the wheel of one of five one
    of the 3 heart pounding courses. All this, while smashing into super cars and
    experience your opponents car(s) and collecting valuable points, as you pass
    all the checkpoints in the allotted time. \r\n"
