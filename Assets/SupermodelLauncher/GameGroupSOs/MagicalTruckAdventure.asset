  gameSynopsis: "Sega takes Inter-Active Action to the extreme with exciting \u201CMagical\r
    Truck Adventure\"\r\n\nMagical Truck Adventure, featuring Sega's Model 3 Step
    2.0/2.1 technology, gives the player the feel of actually riding a rail car.
    An action-pedal and truck lever assist the player in chasing, jumping, and dodging
    the evil villains that threaten to steal Alma's precious stone. All this excitement
    takes place on a railroad track, with 6 amazingly detailed scenic routes. The
    3 challenging stages include an array of obstacles, wild Rhino's, hungry crocodiles,
    and speeding trains, to name a few. An additional challenge is in preventing
    the rail track from being destroyed, which will ensure a quick end to the Magical
    Truck Adventure. Magical Truck Adventure, a sure way to bring inter-active game
    play to any location!\r\n"
