  gameSynopsis: "The Ultimate Street\r Fighting Machine\r\n\r\nSega's R&D 2 Departments
    AM2's revolutionary new 3-D fighting video game, SpikeOut, will certainly change
    the face of fighting games. This unique concept allows players to determine the
    course of each stage by traveling down main streets or back alley ways. Other
    players may join in the fight at any time during the battle. These players may
    choose to help the other players or go off on their own to fight their own battles.
    If the players are successful in getting to the end of each stage, they must
    then defeat the stages \"Big Boss\" to advance to the next stage.\r\n\nMultiple
    weapons and power-ups, which increase the characters' life and fighting power,
    can be found on each route."
