  gameSynopsis: 'Take to the High Seas Underwater Adventure!



    Horrific monsters
    have been sighted in each of the seven seas!



    Players of all ages will
    literally be drawn to this game by the incredible graphics being produced by
    Sega''s Model 3 Step 2 technology. The intense gameplay and action charged guns
    create a heart pounding underwater experience never before seen in an arcade
    video game.



    Players will encounter an array of marine life, which dominate
    the seven seas, while exploring ancient ruins indicating the inhabitance of a
    civilization long ago. All the while, being fascinated by the spectrum of colors,
    created by the sun light shining through the water. The battle is not only against
    the threatening marine life, but the titanic icebergs, which are capable of sinking
    the Ocean Hunter.
