  gameSynopsis: "At last, fishing without the creepy worm!\r\n\r\nYour timing has
    to be perfect. Feel the bite transmitted through the rod and pull him in. Not
    too hard! If you reel too forcibly, your rod will break and you'll lose that
    fish forever. You get three shots at the big one, so you better make them all
    count! A 50\" monitor, with vivid action scenes, throws you in the water with
    real video footage. Sega's aquatic sound effects bring the water alive with true
    detail! \r\n\r\nWith rod and reel in hand, find out who is better at the sport
    of fishing, you or 24 different breed of fish.\r\n"
