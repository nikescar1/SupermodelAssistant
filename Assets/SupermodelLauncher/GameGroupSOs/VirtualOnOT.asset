  gameSynopsis: "You won't believe how frenetic and explosive! \n\nGiant virtuaroids
    rule the arena, each with a unique weapons array and thirst for destruction.\r
    And with only one thing in mind - your extinction.\r\n\nKeeping the classic mech
    fighting style, Virtual On returns with Virtual-On: Oratorio Tangram! You control
    one of several robotic beasts from the delicate Angelan to the big, powerful
    Raiden as you try to wipe out your competition in a series of lush, 3D environments.
    Each of the three different weapons can have altering effects depending on the
    situation their employed and the movement of your mech. Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram
    improves upon the hit original game with two new mechs and revised play mechanics."
