  gameSynopsis: "The Force, the Speed, the Reality!\r\n\nStick the Pedal to the Metal
    \n\nWith vibrant colors and roaring engines, race well known stock cars around
    the track at unlimited speeds. Drivers stick the pedal to metal while zooming
    through banks and turns. Using the slipstream to judge the drift before passing
    cars, drivers thrill crowds with the exciting close-up action! However, proceed
    with caution! Get too close and drivers can end up crashing so hard that you'll
    see sparks fly! \r\n\nThe inspiring power of the Model 3 Step 2.0 board outputs
    over 1 million polygons per second creating precise visuals of the racetrack
    and cars' chassis, even accomplishing the smoke and flames! The newest technologies
    combined with Sega's unsurpassed know-how contribute to the stunning simulation
    or real-life stock car racing! \r\n"
